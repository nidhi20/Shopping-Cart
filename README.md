# Shopping Cart Webpage

A company wants to create a virtual store online book sales. The bookstore contains a number of books divided into categories. The online customer can place one or more orders by selecting the book title and entering the desired amount.
Once the customer completes the selection of books, the customer can view the cart of purchases and the purchases.

My job was to write a JavaScript function called calculerAfficherDetailsAchats ()
to calculate and display the purchase details. This function offers the following features:

1. Get all the books selected by the customer
2. Find the book title, unit price, quantity and the cost of the order (price times quantity)
3. Calculate the total cost of all orders
4. Displays details of purchases
